<p>To all who come to his happy blog, welcome!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For just over 3 years, MouseGuests has shared our Disney obsession over social media outlets such as <a href="https://twitter.com/mouseguests">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MouseGuests">Facebook</a>. But we&#8217;ve felt that sometimes those options were limited and we had more to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So today, just in time for our next trip to Walt Disney World, we&#8217;re pleased to unveil our brand new blog! Here we&#8217;ll share news, tips, tricks, trip reports, and anything else that we think our Disney-crazed readers will enjoy. We&#8217;ll focus primarily on Disney vacations such as Walt Disney World, Disneyland, and the Disney Cruise Line, but might toss in other tidbits of Disney info from time to time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Disneyland&#8217;s opening day in July 1955, there were a few hiccups and things didn&#8217;t go as smoothly as Walt would have hoped. Likewise, we may have a few wrinkles to sort out over the next few weeks with regard to styling and layout; so please pardon our pixie dust as we are just getting started. But stick with us and we hope to put together a Disney-oriented blog that will a source of joy and inspiration to all who read it!</p>
