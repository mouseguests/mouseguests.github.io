I suppose that this is bittersweet news: Both Joy and Sadness from Pixar's "Inside Out" are set to join Baymax in the newly expanded Character Spot in Epcot next month! In case you've not seen "Inside Out", Joy and Sadness are two of the emotions that define Riley's personality, along with Anger, Fear, and Disgust. 

Unlike the classic Disney characters that meet in the original Character Spot, there will be no FastPass+ option to meet Baymax or Joy and Sadness. Given the popularity of the movie and the newness of these characters, we expect this to be a very popular meet-n-greet with a long line. If you are hoping to meet them, you'll want to plan accordingly.

Does this new meet-n-greet give you joy or does it make you sad? Leave us a comment and let us know what you think!
