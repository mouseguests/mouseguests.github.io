The weather is getting warmer, the days are getting longer, and the trees and flowers are coming to life. That can only mean one thing: It’s time for the Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival! One of our favorite things about the Flower & Garden Festival is all of the topiaries spread around Epcot that resemble Disney characters. This year, the festival runs for 3 months and there are over 3 dozen topiaries, including a brand new Ranger Mickey topiary to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the National Parks Service!

So this week, we’re asking you which of the Flower & Garden topiaries is your favorite? Do you whistle while you walk past Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs topiaries in the Germany Pavilion? Do the Lady and the Tramp topiaries in the Italy Pavilion make it a bella notte? Do the Cinderella and Prince Charming topiaries in the France Pavilion make you dance? 

Leave us a comment and let us know which topiary is your favorite? If you’ve never been to Epcot during the International Flower & Garden Festival, then search the web for photos of the topiaries (there are lots, including on our https://www.instagram.com/mouseguests/[Instagram]) and pick your favorite. And don’t garden alone: Invite your friends, family, neighbors, horticulturist, everyone at the local nursery, and any lawn maintenance crew you see to come check out MouseGuests and join in on the conversation!
