Purple MagicBand fans rejoice! Purple is now an option in MyMagic+!

When MagicBands were first introduced over 3 years ago, they came in a handful of colors such as red, yellow, orange, green, blue, and pink. But purple was strangely missing from that list. And it has been one of the most requested MagicBand colors ever since. Recently, purple MagicBands have been available for a cost, but they still weren't available as one of the free choices when planning a Disney World vacation.

Are you excited about the addition of purple to the MagicBand lineup? If you could add another color choice, what would pick? Leave a comment and let us know.
