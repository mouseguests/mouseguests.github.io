Visitors to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom will no longer be able to use FastPass+ to secure prime locations for viewing _Festival of Fantasy Parade_, _The Main Street Electrical Parade_, or _Wishes_. If you want to see these shows, you'll need to stake out a spot without the help of the FastPass+ system.

And this is just fine with us. Although we've used FastPass+ once for viewing _Festival of Fantasy_, we found that it wasn't very useful. Even with FastPass+, it helped to show up 30 minutes or more before the show started...at which time other great spots could also be had without FastPass+. Moreover, using FastPass+ for the nighttime shows would tie up your last FastPass+ selection, preventing you from obtaining additional selections at the kiosks (or coming soon, in the My Disney Experience app). 

If you're looking for the best viewing for either of the Magic Kingdom parades, we recommend that you look for a location on the west side of the hub, between the Liberty Square bridge and the _Partners_ statue. The parades will go past this spot and shortly before the parade comes by, cast members will run a rope between the bridge and the hub. You'll want to be just inside of where that rope will be to get a great view of either parade. Alternatively, if you're running a bit late to catch that spot, there are also some great spots in Liberty Square and Frontierland. Just look for the areas on the ground that are taped off and find one that lets you stand just inside of the tape. 

For Wishes, the best location is from the lift hill on _Big Thunder Mountain_. But since that requires careful timing and you won't be able to see the entire show, you might want to find any spot near the hub, south of the _Parters_ statue. Avoid getting too close to the castle or else it will block your view of some of the fireworks. The platform at the Main Street train station is also a good location for viewing _Wishes_. And for something entirely different, consider viewing the fireworks from a boat on _Ferrytale Wishes Dessert Cruise_ or _Pirates and Pals Fireworks Voyage_. We've taken the _Pirates and Pals Fireworks Voyage_ and can say it's a lot of fun and has a magnificent view of _Wishes_ from the Seven Seas Lagoon.
