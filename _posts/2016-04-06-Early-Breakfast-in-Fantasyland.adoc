One of the biggest decisions you'll make when planning a Disney World vacation is whether to eat a good breakfast before going to the parks or going straight to the parks to be the first in line for some of your favorite attractions. Now you can choose both if you take advantage of "Disney Early Morning Magic".

On select mornings from 7:45-10:00am, a very limited number of guests will be the first to enter the Magic Kingdom and Fantasyland. At _Pinocchio Village Haus_, you can enjoy a breakfast that includes pastries, fruits, scrambled eggs, waffles, bacon, sausage, and much more. And before the crowds get too heavy, you'll have quick access to _Peter Pan's Flight_, _Seven Dwarfs Mine Train_, and _The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh_. 

This special early morning access to Fantasyland will cost $69 for adults and $59 for children (ages 3-9) in addition to regular park admission. It appears that it will be offered on most Tuesday and Saturday mornings starting April 26th. If this is something you think you might want to try out, you can read more about it and check for availability by clicking https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/early-morning-magic[here].

It's important to understand that although this event runs from 7:45-10:00am, the Magic Kingdom still opens at 9:00am on those days. So participating guests will only have exclusive access to Fantasyland for an hour and 15 minutes (unless they plan to keep Fantasyland closed to regular guests until 10:00am--which is unlikely). Therefore, we're undecided if breakfast plus quick access to those three rides in such a short period of time justifies the $69/person price tag. In comparison, breakfast at _Cinderella's Royal Table_ is roughly $60 for adults and $36 for children, which includes the experience of dining in the castle, albeit without quick access to 3 Fantasyland attractions.
