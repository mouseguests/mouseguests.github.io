The First Avenger and your friendly neighborhood webslinger are scheduled to start meeting guests in Disney California Adventure starting April 3rd. This also marks a move of Disneyland's Marvel presence to Disney California Adventure as Marvel HQ is set to close on April 2.

For the past couple of years, Disneyland guests have been able to virtually suit up in Tony Stark's Iron Man suit, see a collection of Iron Man suits, and cross the bifrost to meet Thor in Disneyland's Tomorrowland. But now it seems that the second floor of the former Innoventions building (which also once housed the Carousel of Progress and America Sings) will be taking on a new tenant.

We can't help but wonder what this means, both for the Innoventions building as well as for Marvel's presence at the Disneyland Resort. There have been rumors for awhile that Disney California Adventure would someday be expanded with a Marvel-themed area. Could this be a first small move in that direction? And what will become of the Innoventions building? Will Star Wars Launch Bay expand to the second floor or does Disney have other plans for the space?

What do you think of this move? Leave a comment and let's discuss it!
