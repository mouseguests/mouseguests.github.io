One of the most colorful times of the year blooms today at Epcot: The Epcot International Flower and Garden Festival!

Between now and May 30th, visitors to Epcot will experience a landscape that has come alive with colorful flowers and topiaries designed after beloved Disney and Pixar characters. If you have (or desire to have) a green thumb, there will also be gardening experts on-hand, giving tips on gardening at the festival center. And since gardening can build up an appetite, there are over a dozen outdoor kitchens setup around World Showcase, offering specialty dishes, desserts, and drinks. 

On the weekends, catch the rhythms and sounds of Garden Rocks Concert Series at the America Gardens Theater. This year, the concert series features:

 * March 4-6: The Orchestra starring former members of ELO
 * March 11-13: STARSHIP featuring Mickey Thomas
 * March 18-20: Little River Band
 * March 25-27: Village People
 * April 1-3: Herman's Hermits starring Peter Noone
 * April 8-10: The Guess Who
 * April 15-17: Blod, Sweat, and Tears starring Bo Bice
 * April 22-24: Bad Company starring Brian Howe
 * April 29-May 1: Georgia Satellits
 * May 6-8: Gin Blossoms
 * May 13-15: Darlene Love
 * May 20-22: Night Ranger
 * May 27-30: The Spinners
 
That's three months full of flowers, food, and music to take in when visiting Epcot!
