It has been an amazing July for Disney Parks fans who enjoy bringing Disney into their home. The http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/[Disney Parks Blog] has been live-streaming every Monday, starting with _Celebrate America_ from the Magic Kingdom on July 4th. Then we watched _Mickey's Royal Friendship Faire_ from the Magic Kingdom on July 11th. And just last week we tuned in to watch _Star Wars: A Galactic Spectacular_ from Disney's Hollywood Studios. 

Tonight, the Disney Parks Blog wraps up a month of live streaming with the dazzling _Paint the Night_ parade from Disneyland. You'll definitely want to tune into the Disney Parks Blog tonight at 8:50pm PT (11:50pm ET) to see the show. The best way to view the parade is to use an HDMI adapter to hook your computer, tablet, or phone up to a larger television so that you can share the experience with friends and family.

In case you've not seen _Paint the Night_ before, it is a modern take on a nighttime electrical parade, including 8 floats, 76 performers, and over 1.5 million LED lights. The soundtrack for the parade includes a blend of "Baroque Hoedown", Owl City's "When Can I See You Again?", and several Disney classics. It's a MUST-SEE parade (in our opinion, the best parade Disney has ever done)!
