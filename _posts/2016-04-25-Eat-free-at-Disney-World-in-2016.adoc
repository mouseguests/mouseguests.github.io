Anyone who has ever been to Walt Disney World can tell you that if you leave feeling hungry, you've done something wrong. Disney World has some of the most amazing dining options you can find anywhere. Sure you can find burgers and turkey legs, staples of theme park dining. But there are many more choices to satisfy even the most critical palates, including several fine dining options.

As if a trip to Walt Disney World isn't magical enough, what if you could go and eat for free? Today Disney has announced free dining for select resorts and dates in 2016. All you need to do is book non-discounted 5-night/6-day package that includes a room at one of the participating Walt Disney World Resort hotels and tickets with the _Park Hopper_ or _Water Parks & More_ option.

The dates included in this offer are for arrivals most nights:

 * August 23 - October 1, 2016
 * November 15 - November 21, 2016
 * November 26 - November 28, 2016
