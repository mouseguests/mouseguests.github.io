Did you watch the live stream of "Celebrate America!" last night on the Disney Parks Blog? Disney's fireworks displays are amazing and their 4th of July spectacular was a dazzling example of how well Disney does pyrotechnics.

Last night's live stream was just the first live stream on the Disney Parks Blog this month. Just before the show, they announced that there will be a live streaming event every Monday in July! The schedule for the rest of the month is as follows:

 * (July 11th) _Mickey's Royal Friendship Faire_ - The new stage show that debuted last month at Cinderella Castle in the Magic Kingdom.
 * (July 18th) _Star Wars: A Galactic Spectacular_ - This new nighttime show in Disney's Hollywood Studios celebrates the entire Star Wars galaxy with fireworks, projections, and music.
 * (July 25th) _Paint the Night_ - The dazzing electric parade from Disneyland that debuted as part of Disneyland's Diamond Celebration last summer.

Even though we can't go to Disney World and Disneyland as often as we'd like, it's great to be able to experience the Disney Parks from home with these live streaming events. Stay tuned to MouseGuests.com and/or follow use on https://www.facebook.com/MouseGuests[Facebook] and https://twitter.com/mouseguests[Twitter] for more details on these events.
