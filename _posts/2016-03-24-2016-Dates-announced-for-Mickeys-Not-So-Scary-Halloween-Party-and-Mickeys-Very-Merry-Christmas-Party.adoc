There's no party like a Disney party! And dates for the Magic Kingdom's two biggest holiday parties, _Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party_ and _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_, have been announced!

For trick-or-treating fun in the Magic Kingdom this fall, try _Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party_. In addition to enjoying many of the Magic Kingdom's fun attractions, you'll also be able to meet with some unique characters in their Halloween costumes and see the villainous _Boo to You_ parade! There are also trick-or-treat stations setup around the park for satisfying your sweet tooth! The party dates are: September 2, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20, 23, 25, 29, 30, and October 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31.

For a joyous Christmas celebration, you can also visit _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_. There will be several holiday celebrations, including a special Christmas parade and fireworks show, and meet and greet several characters in their holiday best! You'll also be able to pick up complimentary cookies at several locations around the Magic Kingdom. The Christmas party takes place on the following dates: November 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 27, 29, and December 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 22.

Both of these parties are hard-ticket after-hours events (that is, you must purchase a ticket for the party that is distinct from park admission) and tend to sell out rather quickly. If you think you might want to go to one of these parties, reserve your tickets soon.
