Yesterday, Disney invited members of the press and blogging/podcasting communities to go behind the construction walls at several of the new attractions and shows coming to Walt Disney World this summer. Unfortunately, MouseGuests was not invited (_Disney, if you're reading this, please consider inviting us next time!_), so we had to follow along from home on Twitter. Nevertheless, we have some updates on what is coming to Disney's Animal Kingdom.

As you may already know, _Rivers of Light_, the new nighttime show on the Discovery River in Animal Kingdom, has been delayed. Although it was supposed to debut this Friday, technical problems have prompted Disney to delay the opening of the show. Rumor is that they're having a difficult time with the GPS systems keeping the barges from crashing into each other in the currents of the Discovery River. At this time, it is unknown when _Rivers of Light_ will open. 

Nevertheless, the setbacks on _Rivers of Light_ will not stop Disney from opening Animal Kingdom's other new experiences, including _Discovery Island Carnivale_, _Harambe Wildlife Parti_, the new nighttime _Kilimanjaro Safaris_, and _Tree of Life Nighttime Awakenings_. In addition, Disney announced last night that while the glitches are being worked out with _Rivers of Light_, an interim show, _Jungle Book: Alive with Magic_, will be shown on the Discovery River nightly, featuring scenes from the hit live action _Jungle Book_ movie. 

(We've seen a few videos taken of the _Tree of Life Nighttime Awakenings_ from last night and it looks amazing.)

Starting on Memorial Day Weekend, Animal Kingdom will be open until 8pm for guests to experience the park after dark. Additionally, the new _Tiffins_ restaurant will be open for lunch and dinner starting that same weekend.

Although we're disappointed that _Rivers of Light_ and these new experiences won't be available while we're in Disney World at the end of this month, we're excited about what's coming to Disney's Animal Kingdom. We'll patiently wait for the kinks to be worked out with _Rivers of Light_ and be all the more anxious to see it on our next trip.

What do you think of these new experiences coming to Disney's Animal Kingdom? Leave a comment and let us know!
