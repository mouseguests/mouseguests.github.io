http://www.mouseguests.com/2016/06/02/Walkin-Around-the-World.html[Last Month] I shared a brief trip report on how many miles we logged while walking around Disney World in May. As promised then, I'm now following up on a similar report from our visit to Disneyland in June.

On this trip, we went with some friends who have never been to Disneyland before. Because of that, we felt compelled to show them as much of Disneyland as we possibly could--which, of course, meant a lot of walking. 

Although similarly designed, Disneyland Park is quite a bit smaller than Disney World's Magic Kingdom (85 acres vs. 107 acres). In spite of the small size, there's a lot to do in both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. And since the parks are relatively close to each other and close to all of the resort hotels, you find yourself walking a lot more than riding a bus or a monorail.

Here's a brief rundown of each day of the trip:

 * June 4th - 4.48 miles : This was primarily a day of travel. We didn't even leave home until lunchtime and our flight landed at LAX at around 4pm. We didn't even bother going into the parks on this day. Instead, we walked around Downtown Disney and had dinner at _White Water Snacks_ in Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. Even so, we put in nearly 5 miles worth of airport and Downtown Disney walking.
 * June 5th - 9.38 miles : We always try to bookend our Disneyland trips in Disneyland Park. We entered the park at rope drop. After a few Fantasyland dark rides, the girls went to a Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique appointment while the guys rode _Big Thunder Mountain_ and _Star Tours_. We had lunch at Cafe Orleans (the Monte Cristo is amazing!) and made sure to catch _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_ (as it'd be the only day it was running during our trip) and later saw _Paint the Night_. Due to high winds, _Disneyland Forever_ was cancelled, so we'd have to see it on another night. Overall, we didn't have a well-formed plan for this day, so we zig-zagged a lot, resulting in the high number of miles.
 * June 6th - 9.33 miles : On our second day, we went to Disney California Adventure. We started early enough to ride _Radiator Springs Racers_ a couple of times in a row, before working our way counter-clockwise around the park, hitting Bugs Land and the _Tower of Terror_ (twice in a row) next. We met up with Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps in Hollywoodland. It was at this point we realized that there was no way we'd be able to see _Frozen-Live at the Hyperion_ on this day, so we continued our trek around the park. We left the park for a bit for dinner at _Goofy's Kitchen_, before returning to the Paradise Pier area for that evening's showing of _World of Color-Celebrate!_.
 * June 7th - 8.96 miles : The next day found us again in Disney California Adventure. Most of the crew stayed in the Grizzly Peak Airfield area and rode _Soarin'_ (still the original at that time) while I stood in line to get Fastpasses for _Frozen-Live at the Hyperion_. With Fastpasses in hand, I returned to ride _Soarin'_ myself and then we all went back to Hollywoodland to ride _Monsters, Inc. Mike and Sulley to the Rescue!_ before standing in an oppressively claustrophobic line to get into the Hyperion Theater. After seeing the new _Frozen_ show (which, was amazing and well worth seeing), we headed over to _Storyteller's Cafe_ at the Grand Californian for lunch. After returning to the park, we rode as many Paradise Pier attractions as we could fit in, then ended our day with some ice cream from _Clarabelle's_ and one more ride on _Radiator Springs Racers_.
 * June 8th - 8.34 miles : On our final day with our friends, we hit Disneyland Park once again. We rode the monorail into the park and rode _Matterhorn Bobsleds_ before breakfast at _Plaza Inn_ (hands-down the best character meal in either Disney World or Disneyland). Then set out to hit as many attractions as we could. We picked up Fastpasses for _Hyperspace Mountain_ and signed the kids up for _Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple_. Then we headed to ToonTown, met Mickey Mouse at his house, rode _Gadget's Go Coaster_ and _Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin_. Unfortunately, Jedi Training ended up being cancelled, but they made up for it by letting us walk right in to see Kylo Ren. And we visited (and hugged) Chewbacca while we were there. At some point, we waited in a very long line for Dole Whips and continued to ride as many rides as we could before saying goodbye to our friends in Downtown Disney.
 * June 9th - 6.54 miles : The next day, Raymie woke up not feeling well, so we slept in before going to _Ariel's Grotto_ for lunch. After lunch, Raymie went back to the hotel room while me and the girls explored Disney California Adventure by ourselves. Given that Madi isn't much of a thrill-ride junkie, we stayed clear of _Tower of Terror_ and _California Screamin'_ (and we had ridden them earlier in the week) and spent most of our day in Paradise Pier and Cars Land. We ended the day relatively early by riding _Soarin'_ again. Later, Maisy and I walked back over to Disneyland Park where we hid out in the _Main Street Cinema_ waiting for _Paint the Night_ to pass by so we could see _Disneyland Forever_. 
 * June 10th - 3.76 miles : On our last day, we had planned to go to Disneyland Park, but Raymie still wasn't feeling better and if we were to go, we'd need to buy a 1-day ticket (we had only bought a 5-day ticket for the first part of the week), so we decided to take it easy and walk around Downtown Disney for awhile. We had lunch at _Earl of Sandwich_ and then Maisy and I walked over to the Disneyland Hotel to look around and see the scale model of _Big Thunder Mountain_ in the lobby of the Frontier Tower. Then we waited in the lobby of the Grand Californian, hunted for hidden Mickeys, and finally boarding our bus back to LAX to go home. (Interesting note: We saw Dave Foley, the voice of _A Bug's Life_'s Flik and actor in a handful of TV shows) was outside about to check into the hotel as we were leaving.)

Note that all of these miles were reported by the built-in "Health" app on my iPhone 6S. I've found it to be relatively accurate, but other pedometers may have provided slightly different numbers. In short, your mileage may vary (pun intended).

Crunching those numbers we get:

 * 50.79 total miles walked during the trip; averaging 7.26 miles per day
 * 42.55 miles walked on days we enter the parks; averaging 8.51 miles per day
 * 17.72 miles walked on the two days spent in Disneyland Park; averaging 8.86 miles per day
 * 24.83 miles walked on the three days spent in Disney California Adventure; averaging 8.28 miles per day

Not surprisingly, our feet were sore and tired by the end of the trip. As usual, I wore my Teva sandals and they were fine for the most part. That last day in Disneyland Park (June 8th) my feet were in rather extreme pain by the end of the day, but I suspect that has more to do with the fact that I rarely sat down for most of the day and even then for only short breaks. My feet were much better the next day, however. 

That said, I am beginning to acknowledge that maybe I should try something other than sandals on our next trip. I've heard nothing but good things about shoes from http://www.kurufootwear.com/[Kuru Footwear]. Doing some self-diagnosis, prior to learning about Kuru, I think I might suffer from plantar fasciitis and Kuru claims to have shoes that help with that. Unfortunately, I have wide feet and their only shoes that measure wide aren't currently in stock for my shoe size. But I hope to be able to give them a try on our next Disney trip.

How many miles have you walked in Disney World or Disneyland? Do you have any tips on how to keep your feet comfortable when in the parks? Leave a comment and let us know!
