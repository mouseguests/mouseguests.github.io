We just wanted to remind you one more time about the live streaming event tonight presented by the http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog[Disney Parks Blog]. Starting at 4:30pm Pacific (7:20pm Eastern), they will be presenting _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_, live from Disneyland!

For those who have never seen _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_, it is a highly energetic, musical celebration that starts in Fantasyland (near _it's a small world_) and moves down Main Street U.S.A., led by none other than Mickey Mouse playing drums on the lead float. It includes several beloved Disney characters including Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, Aurora, Cinderella, Belle, Rapunzel, Aladdin, the Genie, Tiana, Simba, and Mary Poppins. You won't want to miss it!
