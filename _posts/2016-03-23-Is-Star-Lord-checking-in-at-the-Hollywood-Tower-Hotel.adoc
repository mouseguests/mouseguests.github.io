In case you've missed it, there's a disturbing rumor circulating this week that Disney is planning on introducing "Guardians of the Galaxy" to Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney California Adventure. The disturbing part of the rumor is that it will come in the form of a re-theme of the _Twilight Zone Tower of Terror_.

I thought "Guardians of the Galaxy" was a great movie and I'd love to see more of it (and other Marvel properties) represented in Disney's parks. However, re-theming the _Tower of Terror_ would be tragic.

The _Tower of Terror_ (speaking primarily of the version in Disney's Hollywood Studios) is a masterpiece, one of the few attractions that undisputedly qualify as E-Tickets. From Epcot's World Showcase, the architecture of the _Tower of Terror_ blends in perfectly as the backdrop of the Morocco Pavilion. From within Disney's Hollywood Studios, the ominous towering structure draws you closer as you look down Sunset Blvd. As you approach the hotel and enter its queue, the gardens and dry fountains will have you believe that you are actually standing outside of a long-abandoned hotel. 

Upon walking into the lobby, the background music and exquisitly detailed theming drive home that belief. The "Out of Order" sign on the elevator door suggests that something unusual has happened here and that you should not venture further. But of course, you do, stepping into the library only to have your heart stop as the thunder cracks and the lights go dim. After Rod Serling establishes the backstory, you step through the boiler room with dim lighting and eery sounds that raise your anxiety. 

Once aboard the elevator, the ride itself is magnificent. First you see an endless hallway with ghosts of hotel guests beckoning you to join them. That hallway fades into a starfield, with only a distant window remaining...until it shatters. Upon arriving at the "5th dimension", the most uncommon elevator leaves the elevator shaft and moves horizontally through strange sights and sounds. 

Finally, the elevator drops only to rise again and drop several more times. After the elevator comes to a rest, you are given a warm welcome back by the voice of Rod Serling and a word of warning to be careful about checking into an abandoned hotel on the dark side of Hollywood.

The _Tower of Terror_ debuted in Disney's Hollywood Studios nearly 20 years ago. Although I've been a passenger on that most uncommon elevator many times, the ride is still as fresh, exciting, and immersive as it was when I first stepped through those doors in 1998. It is one of my favorite attractions, not because of the drop sequence (which is really rather plain compared to the rest of the attraction), but because of the attention to detail and story. It is the ride that first made clear to me that Disney attractions are more about story than a specific ride mechanic.

While I can imagine that a "Guardians of the Galaxy" re-theme of _Tower of Terror_ could be good, I struggle imagining it to be as epic as what has stood at the end of Sunset Blvd. for the past 20 years. I wholly support bringing Marvel to the parks, but not at the expense of what is a very popular and thematically perfect attraction.

Again, this opinion is largely applied to the _Tower of Terror_ in Disney's Hollywood Studios. I have a similar, but weaker opinion for Disney California Adventure's _Tower of Terror_, which I believe to be the inferior implementation (aside from the mirror effect, which I like a lot).

What do you think of this rumor? Would "Guardians of the Galaxy" freshen up the _Tower of Terror_ in favor of the "Twilight Zone" theme that may be too old and lost on today's park visitors? Or is the _Tower of Terror_ a masterpiece that, like da Vinci's _Mona Lisa_ or Michaelangelo's _David_ should remain untouched? Leave us a comment and let's discuss.
