After the switch for _Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights_ was turned off for the last time last year, it left many Disney World fans wondering what, if anything, Disney's Hollywood Studios would offer for the 2016 holiday season. 

Today we've learned that _Jingle Bell, Jingle BAM!_, an all-new fireworks/projection show is debuting this holiday season. The premise of this show is that Santa Claus has gone missing and Wayne and Lanny, the elves from _Prep and Landing_ are leading the search. Holiday scenes featuring favorite Disney characters will be projected on the Chinese Theater while holiday music plays and fireworks light up the skies. And, of course, it wouldn't be a Disney World holiday celebration without snow!

From all appearances, this show uses the same projection technology as the popular _Star Wars: A Galactic Spectacular_, which appears to be going on hiatus for the holiday season starting November 7th.

The first scheduled showing of _Jingle Bell, Jingle BAM_ is for November 14th. For more information about _Jingle Bell, Jingle BAM_ check out the announcement story on the https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/10/all-new-holiday-nighttime-spectacular-jingle-bell-jingle-bam-coming-to-disneys-hollywood-studios-at-walt-disney-world-resort/[Disney Parks Blog].

Additionally, we also hear that Santa Claus himself may be hanging around Hollywood Studios this winter for meet and greet opportunities.
