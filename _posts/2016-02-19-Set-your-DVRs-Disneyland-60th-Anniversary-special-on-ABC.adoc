The ABC special _Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60_ airs _this_ Sunday night. Celebrating Disneyland's 60th Anniversary, this show will feature guest celebrities such as Harrison Ford, Idina Menzel, Tori Kelly, Kermit the Frog, Elton John, Pentatonix, Josh Gad, and many more, with Derek Hough serving as master of ceremonies. And, of course, we'll get to see Disneyland itself as well as Disney California Adventure, including peeks at the _Paint the Night_ parade and _World of Color: Celebrate!_. 

You will not want to miss this show! Clear your calendar, set your DVR (so you can watch it over and over again), and pop some corn (or make some homemade churros)...and tune in to ABC at 8pm (7pm central) to celebrate Disneyland's 60th Anniversary from the comfort of your home!
