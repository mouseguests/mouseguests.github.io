If you're thinking about going to Disney World or Disneyland this year, you should consider getting your tickets _NOW_. It's been rumored for quite awhile and today we've heard from several sources that Disney will introduce demand pricing, based on expected crowd levels, very soon (possibly this weekend).

The idea is that there are times of the year that the parks are busier than other times. During those times, with demand high, admission prices will be higher than on slower days. This is a good-news/bad-news proposition for guests. In theory, it may help even out the crowds, making some of the busier days less busy (while making some of the slower days busier). But it also means that if you want to visit Disney on a busy day, it may cost you more.

Demand pricing is not unusual in the travel industry. Airlines, hotels, and other resorts have employed it for years. Recently, Universal Studios Hollywood introduced demand pricing. And when Shanghai Disneyland opens this summer, it is expected to sell tickets with demand pricing.

The details of this new plan are still unknown. It's unclear what effect, if any, it will have on tickets purchased as part of vacation packages. Stay tuned to this blog and we'll update you as soon as we find out more. In the meantime, you may want to consider getting your tickets/vacation booked ASAP.
