As we've http://www.mouseguests.com/2016/08/10/Main-Street-Electrical-Parade-Returns-to-Disneyland.html[reported before], the _Main Street Electrical Parade_ will be leaving Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom on October 9th to return home to Disneyland. Before it leaves the Magic Kingdom, however, there's one more chance for all of us to watch it roll down Main Street U.S.A.

The Disney Parks Blog has https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/08/inside-disney-parks-new-main-street-electrical-parade-povs-live-announcement/[just announced] that they'll be live-streaming the _Main Street Electrical Parade_ this Sunday night, August 28th, at 8:55pm Eastern. Mark your calendar and gather the family around to see the parade one last time before it glows away from the Magic Kingdom.
