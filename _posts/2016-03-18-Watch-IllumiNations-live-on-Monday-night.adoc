As you probably know, Disney puts on some amazing nighttime shows. And on Monday night (March 21st), you'll be able to enjoy one of them from the comfort of home. The Disney Parks Blog will be live streaming _IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth_ on Monday night at 8:50pm (eastern)!

_IllumiNations_ is one of Disney's largest nighttime spectaculars, taking place on Epcot's World Showcase Lagoon. When viewing _IllumiNations_ in Epcot, you can see it from almost any location along the 1.2 mile circumference of the lagoon. The show includes fireworks, lasers, fire, and a spinning globe which is actually a spherical video display. Along with a breathtaking musical score composed by Gavin Greenaway, the show takes place in 3 acts: Chaos, Order, and Meaning. 

Be sure to tune in to the https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/[Disney Parks Blog] on Monday evening to watch the _IllumiNations_ live streaming event. You don't want to miss it! We'll post more information about the show on Monday as it becomes available.
