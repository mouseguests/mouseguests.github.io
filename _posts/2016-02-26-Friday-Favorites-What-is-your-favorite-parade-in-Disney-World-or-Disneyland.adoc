Earlier this week, we had a chance to watch _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_, live streamed from Disneyland. And this past Sunday night, we got a glimpse of Disneyland's _Paint the Night Parade_ while watching _Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60_ on ABC. No doubt, Disney knows how to put on a parade!

So this week, we wanted to ask you which of Disney's parades is your favorite? Does your foot tap along to the beat in _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_? Do you prefer the classic _Main Street Electrical Parade_? Maybe it's the wondrous and wonderful _Disney's Festival of Fantasy Parade_ in the Magic Kingdom. How about the _Pixar Play Parade_ in Disney California Adventure? Or does _Paint the Night_ leaving you asking "When can we do this again?"?

Since there are only a handful of parades currently running in Disney's U.S. parks, feel free to suggest a retired parade or a parade from one of Disney's parks in Paris, Tokyo, or Hong Kong. So if you loved _Spectromagic_, _Tapestry of Nations_, _Mickey's Jammin' Jungle Parade_, or Tokyo's _Dreamlights_, we want to hear from you!

Which Disney parade is your favorite? Leave a comment below and let us know. And don't forget to tell your friends, neighbors, family, electrician, plumber, and everyone in the theater the next time you go see a movie, to come follow MouseGuests and join in on the fun!
