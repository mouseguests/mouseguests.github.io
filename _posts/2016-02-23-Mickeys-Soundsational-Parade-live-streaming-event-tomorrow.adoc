There's no question that Disney puts on some amazing parades. One of the best parades that is currently run in the parks is _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_ in Disneyland. Tomorrow when _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_ steps off at 4:15pm Pacific (7:15pm Eastern), the http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog[Disney Parks Blog] will be streaming it live for you to watch from home!

While not as much of a classic as the _Main Street Electrical Parade_ or as flashy as _Paint the Night_, _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_ is an incredibly fun parade with some great floats and an energetic soundtrack. And I'll even be so bold as to suggest that the float designs are almost on par with those from _Disney's Festival of Fantasy Parade_ in the Magic Kingdom.

The parade is led by Mickey Mouse playing drums while riding on a Mickey-shaped float. In fact, drums are a key component of every other float in the parade, with characters such as Aladdin, Donald Duck, Tinkerbell, and the _Lion King's_ Simba riding atop drum-shaped floats. Other floats in the parade are themed more closely to the movies and characters they represent, including floats for _The Little Mermaid_, _The Princess and the Frog_, and _Mary Poppins_, as well as a float that carries Cinderella, Aurora, Belle, and Rapunzel.

Even though _Paint the Night_ has all of the attention for the past year, it'd be a mistake to visit Disneyland and miss _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_. Sadly, this was a mistake we made on our last trip to Disneyland, so we're looking forward to making up for it in some small part by watching the live streaming event later today.

Visit the http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog[Disney Parks Blog] or keep an eye on this post to get details on where to watch the live stream event. We'll update this post with a link as soon as we know more details. We also recommend, if possible, to hook your computer, smart phone, or tablet up to the biggest TV in your home for this event. We did that for the _Fantasmic!_ live streaming event last month and it made the experience so much more fun!

Are you looking forward to watching the _Mickey's Soundsational Parade_ live streaming event? Leave a comment and let us know! And come back during or after the parade to share your thoughts on what you saw!
