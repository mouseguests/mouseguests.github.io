Earlier this year, we sadly said goodbye to _Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular_ in Disney California Adventure's Hyperion Theater. But coming May 27th, you'll be able to see _Frozen - Live at the Hyperion_ an all new musical adaptation of the popular Disney film _Frozen_.

Disney promises elaborate costumes, sets, special effects, puppetry, and music to make this a must-see show. If it's anything nearly as good as its predecessor, it will be amazing.

Disney has also announced that with the new _Frozen_ show opening in the Hyperion Theater, _For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration_ will be closing on April 17th. We're hopeful that this means that _Muppet*Vision 3D_ will be returning to Disney California Adventure shortly thereafter.

Are you excited to see _Frozen - Live at the Hyperion_? Do you think it will match up to _Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular_? Leave a comment and let us know!
