For the past few years, Magic Kingdom guests have celebrated a world filled with magic with _Celebrate the Magic_ projection show. That show lights up Cinderella Castle for the last time on November 3rd to make way for an all new projection show, "Once Upon a Time" which premieres on the night of November 4th.

Join Mrs. Potts (from _Beauty and the Beast_) as she tells Chip a bedtime story including scenes from favorite Disney stories from _Peter Pan_, _Cinderella_, _Bambi_, _The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh_, and others.

_Once Upon a Time_ is inspired by a similar show that has been running in Tokyo Disneyland for a few years.
