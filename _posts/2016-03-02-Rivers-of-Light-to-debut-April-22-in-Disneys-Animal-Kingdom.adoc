After many months of anticipation, Disney has confirmed that the new _Rivers of Light_ nighttime spectacular will debut in Disney's Animal Kingdom on April 22.

This all new show, which takes place on the Discovery River between _Expedition Everest_ and the _Tree of Life_ will use water screen projections, lanterns, and projections on the _Tree of Life_ and surrounding landscape to tell a story of four animal Spirit Guides. Based on concept art and some sneak peaks offered by Disney Imagineers, this appears to be a nighttime spectacular on the same level as _World of Color_ in Disney California Adventure.

The April 22nd debut date is significant in that it is recognized as both Earth Day and as the 18th anniversary of Disney's Animal Kingdom. And, we're quite excited about _Rivers of Light_ debuting on this date, as it is a full week before we make our next visit to Disney World and so we will be able to see this new show shortly after it opens!
