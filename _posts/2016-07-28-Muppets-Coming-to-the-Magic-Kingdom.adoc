Starting in October, Sam Eagle, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and other Muppets can be found in the Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square for a retelling of events in American history. _The Muppets Present...Great Moments in American History_ will take place several times daily just outside of _The Hall of Presidents_ and will feature an original song along with the Muppets' own unique brand of humor.

Rumors about the Muppets appearing in Liberty Square started appearing over a month ago and some have noted some minor construction work in the windows near _The Hall of Presidents_ as evidence that something was about to happen. Now it is official. This new show will add some fun and activity to Liberty Square, which is often characterized as solemn and dull. 

What do you think about the Muppets coming to Liberty Square? Is it a welcome change? Or do you see it as a misfit? Leave a comment and let us know.
