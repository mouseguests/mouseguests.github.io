Nobody wants their vacation to be disrupted by a hurricane. But when Florida is your vacation destination, there's a chance you could find yourself stuck inside for even smaller storms, much less a Category 3-4 hurricane. 

Thankfully, Hurricane Matthew weakened and took a path that led it further away from Orlando than expected. Even so, with an abundance of caution, Disney World's parks closed early yesterday and will remain closed today. Visitors to Disney World have no choice but to stay put in the resorts and ride out the storm.

While this may not sound like much fun, we've seen a few people on Twitter tell about how they're making use of their unplanned resort time.

Twitter user @rwkirk shared some photos of Baloo, Pluto, and Donald Duck spending time with guests at Port Orleans French Quarter. https://twitter.com/rwkirk/status/784403570707853312
