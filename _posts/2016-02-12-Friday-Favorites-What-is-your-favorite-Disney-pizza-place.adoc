This past Tuesday was National Pizza Day, which has us wondering: What is your favorite place in Walt Disney World or Disneyland to get a slice or two of pizza?

Do you like the flatbreads served at Pinocchio's Village Haus? Maybe the wood-fired taste of Via Napoli in Epcot? How about a slice from Boardwalk Pizza & Pasta in Disney California Adventure? Or perhaps it's the out of this world pizza at Redd Rocket's Pizza Port in Disneyland. Do your adventures lead you to Pizzafari in Disney's Animal Kingdom? Even though it's future is uncertain, did you enjoy Pizza Planet in Disney's Hollywood Studio? 

Even if it's the PB&J pizza at Goofy's Kitchen in the Disneyland Hotel, we want to hear from you! Where in Walt Disney World or Disneyland is your favorite place to get pizza? Leave a comment and let us know! And don't forget to tell your friends, family, neighbors, classmates, fantasy football league, softball team, and pizza delivery person about MouseGuests and invite them to come join in on the conversation!
