The Candlelight Processional is a popular annual event in Epcot during the holidays. Each night, a celebrity narrator tells the Christmas story along with a 50 piece orchestra and a choir performing Christmas carols. There are three performances per night.

This year's narrator lineup includes perennial favorites such as Steven Curtis Chapman, Neil Patrick Harris, and Whoopi Goldberg. We've personally seen the Candlelight Processional twice, once with Whoopi Goldberg as narrator and another time with Andy Garcia. It is a magnificent event and not to miss.
