As you may know, Disney has offered Extra Magic Hours for years as a perk to guests staying in a Disney resort. And recently Disney has announced "Disney After Hours", a hard-ticket event that gives visitors access to the Magic Kingdom after the park closes for meeting characters, shorter lines at select attractions, and drinks and ice cream. In addition, we've just learned about "Third Shift Magic Hours", a new hard-ticket after-after-hours event coming to the Magic Kingdom. 

"Third Shift Magic Hours" will offer guests a unique opportunity to see the park in ways that virtually nobody ever sees it. Once all of the crowds are gone and the park is completely closed, you'll be able to participate in unique interactive experiences, including (but not limited to): Mickey's Custodial Adventure, Stitch's Street Sweep Sensation, and Pooh's Potty Purification Parade.

Disney spokesperson, Josh Inyu, tells us that this is a prime example of giving guests what they want: "As we survey Disney World visitors, two themes stand out. Guests want longer hours and want the parks to be clean and well-maintained. This new premium experience addresses both of those concerns."

It's our understanding that while this experience will be initially exclusive to the Magic Kingdom, if successful it may be offered at all Disney parks and resorts. 

The price tag for this one of a kind experience is $69, which includes unlimited bottles of water, a grey commemorative jumpsuit, and one-size-fits-all latex gloves. Dates for "Third Shift Magic Hours" will be announced soon. Due to Florida labor laws, "Third Shift Magic Hours" will be limited to visitors 16 years and older.


And now that April 1 as come and gone, we can now reveal this as an April Fools' joke and not real news. In case it wasn't obvious.
