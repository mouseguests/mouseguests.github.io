We're hearing that _Toy Story Midway Mania_ in Disney's Hollywood Studios is closing on March 15th for a one day refurb, likely to complete work in the queue area for a third track to be open sometime this summer.

_Toy Story Midway Mania_ is one of the most popular attractions in not only Disney's Hollywood Studios, but in all of Walt Disney World. This blend of dark ride and video game put guest in front of 3D screens where they shoot balls, throw darts at balloons, and toss pies to earn points. 

The standby line for the attraction is almost always well over an hour and a half, in spite of the fact that it currently has two virtually identical tracks. The popularity of the attraction has prompted Disney to build a third track adjacent to the existing ride for additional capacity. With the third track construction nearing completion, one of the last steps in the project is to rework the queue to accommodate the new track. A similar project is underway in Epcot to add a third theater to the popular _Soarin'_ attraction, which is currently closed and expected to open sometime this summer.

What do you think about this news? Do you welcome the new third track in hopes that it will make it possible for you to ride it more often without spending so much time in line? Leave a comment below and let us know.

EDIT: Updated article to reflect that this is a one-day closure.
