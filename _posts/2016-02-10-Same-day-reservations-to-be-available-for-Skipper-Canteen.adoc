The Jungle Navigation Company's Skipper Canteen opened in late December, blending a unique dining experience with the fun (and corny jokes) of the Jungle Cruise. Unlike other table service restaurants in Disney World, however, Skipper Canteen has not been taking reservations and instead taking walk up guests as patrons. That changes tomorrow...

Starting tomorrow and scheduled to last until February 27th, guests wishing to enjoy the adventurous cuisine of the Skipper Canteen can make same-day reservations by visiting http://jungleskippercanteen.com or by calling 407-993-1933.

Although the Skipper Canteen was open on our last trip to Disney World, we had already planned our meals and couldn't fit it into the trip. I'm hoping to give it a try on a future trip, however, with the "Skip's Mac & Cheese" and "Tastes like Chicken...because it is" being the two menu items that have caught my attention.
