Yesterday at San Diego Comic-Con, Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, dropped the announcement (see what I did there?) that a new Guardians of the Galaxy attraction is coming to Disney California Adventure. The new attraction, named _Guardians of the Galaxy-Mission BREAKOUT!_, is slated to open next summer. 

Fans of the Marvel Universe will finally have an actual attraction in a Disney Park. Up until now, the Marvel presence in Disney's U.S. parks has been limited to meet-n-greets and a display of Iron Man suits. Unfortunately, fans of the _Twilight Zone Tower of Terror_ will be disappointed to find out that the new _Guardians of the Galaxy_ attraction is a retheming of the 12 year old hotel to The Collector's fortress.

The ride's story will be that The Collector has captured the Guardians of the Galaxy andis displaying them in display cases suspended over an abyss. Rocket Raccoon has escaped and has recruited attraction guests to help rescue his colleagues. 

The _Tower of Terror_, as we currently know it, will close at the end of this year for work to begin on the retheming. Rumors are that this is just the first step in a bigger plan to rework the east side of Disney California Adventure to a new Marvel-themed land. 

My opinion: I'm not excited to hear that the _Tower of Terror_'s existing theme is going away, but from what I've seen of the concept art, I'm hopeful that the new theme will be just as fun. And I think that the whole east side of Disney California Adventure is a thematic mess, so I hope that along with this retheming, the entire area can be reworked into a consistent Marvel theme.

I'm also extremely happy that (as far as we know) the _Tower of Terror_ in Disney's Hollywood Studios will remain untouched. Unlike DCA where the _Tower of Terror_ is just shoved in a corner, the DHS _Tower of Terror_ fits thematically perfect at the end of Sunset Boulevard. And, the ride experience of the east coast tower is far superior to that of the west coast tower. As long as the _Tower of Terror_ in Disney's Hollywood Studios is left alone, I'm okay with whatever they want to do to its California counterpart.

For what it's worth, there are rumors circulating that there will be a _Guardians of the Galaxy_ attraction coming to Walt Disney World. But rather then retheme the _Tower of Terror_, the Guardians will be part of an all new ride experience that will replace _Ellen's Energy Adventure_ in Epcot. The jury's still out on whether this makes sense or not or if it will even happen.

What do you think about this news? Are you looking forward to more Marvel in Disney's U.S. parks? Do you think this is a positive move for the _Tower of Terror_? Leave a comment and let us know what you think.
