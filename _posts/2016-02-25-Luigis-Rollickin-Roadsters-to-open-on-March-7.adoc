Disney is reporting that Luigi and Guido are returning from their trip to Italy and reopening Casa Della Tires in Disney California Adventure's Cars Land. When it reopens on March 7th, so will _Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters_, a trackless family ride where each car will have it's own unique "dance" so that no two rides will be the same.

When Cars Land opened in 2012, Casa Della Tires was the home to _Luigi's Flying Tires_, a ride where guests would ride tires on a cushion of air (think really big air hockey table). This was a throwback an early Disneyland attraction, _Flying Saucers_ in Tomorrowland. Unfortunately, the ride system relied heavily on guests actively leaning in different directions to move the tires and many (especially smaller children) had a difficult time moving the vehicles. So while Luigi and Guido went home to Italy, Disney Imagineers replaced it with _Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters_.

What do you think about this change? Will you miss _Luigi's Flying Tires_? Or are you looking forward to _Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters_? Leave a comment and let us know!
