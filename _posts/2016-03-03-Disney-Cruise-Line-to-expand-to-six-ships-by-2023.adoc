In Disney's annual shareholder's meeting this morning (and then quickly followed by the http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/[Disney Parks Blog]), Bob Iger confirmed that two new ships will be added to the Disney Cruise Line fleet. The first will come in 2021 and the next in 2023.

Our first thought was "What will they be named?" So far, no names have been revealed...but we'll keep you posted.
