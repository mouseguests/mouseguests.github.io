How much would you pay to stay a few extra hours in the Magic Kingdom after the park closes to ride a few more rides and meet a few more characters? If you're willing to shell out $149 per person, then you may be interested in _Magic Kingdom: Disney After Hours_, a new hard-ticket event coming to the Magic Kingdom for 7 nights in April and May.

Think of it as _Mickey's Not-So Scary Halloween Party_ or _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_, only without the Halloween or Christmas party aspect. Or like evening Extra Magic Hours for anyone (including guests not staying in a Disney resort) willing to pay extra. Tickets are set to go on sale April 6th for the after hours event on Aprili 14th, 21th, and 28th and May 5th, 8th, 12th, and 19th.

What do you think of this new after-hour event? Is this something you'd be willing to pay extra for? Or do you think Disney is trying this out to see if they can do away with Extra Magic Hours free to resort guests? Leave a comment and let us know!
