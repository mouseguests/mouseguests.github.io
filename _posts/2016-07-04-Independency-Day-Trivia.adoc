Happy 4th of July! 

When you visit Walt Disney World, it's easy to find patriotic references to America. On this Independence Day, we decided it'd be fun to post a few trivia questions about some of those patriotic elements. Every hour or so, we're going to post a trivia question on https://www.facebook.com/MouseGuests[Facebook], https://twitter.com/mouseguests[Twitter], and https://www.instagram.com/mouseguests/[Instagram]. We'll start with a fairly easy one and post it here on our blog as well. The first question is in the picture above: In Muppet*Vision 3D, what is the title of Sam Eagle's glorious 3-hour finale?

For the remaining questions, you need to follow us on either https://www.facebook.com/MouseGuests[Facebook], https://twitter.com/mouseguests[Twitter], or https://www.instagram.com/mouseguests/[Instagram]. Then later today, we'll post the answers to all of the questions here on our blog. When you know the answer, please play along by posting it as a comment or reply.

Have a happy and safe 4th of July!
