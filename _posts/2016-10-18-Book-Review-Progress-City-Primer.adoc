If you're anything like me, you enjoy reading, but struggle to find books that both capture and hold your attention. As a Disney fanatic, however, I've discovered that there are countless books available about Walt Disney, the Walt Disney Company, and the Disney Parks. On the off-chance that some of our _MouseGuests_ readers are looking for a good book to read, I though I'd write some book reviews on this blog, sharing my thoughts on some of the best Disney books I read.

Among the many books on Disney are several books that delve into Disney history, including one that I finished recently, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986205060/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0986205060&linkCode=as2&tag=habumacom-20&linkId=bb1ea4f5992ed4690bbad1c892ec99a3[_Progress City Primer: Stories, Secrets, and Silliness from the Many Worlds of Walt Disney_ by Michael Crawford].

Walt Disney was a storyteller. And virtually everything that has the Disney name on it, from the movies to the theme parks, is wrapped in a story. So it seems fitting that a book that there be a book that tells stories about Disney. That's exactly what _Progress City Primer_ is: a collection of stories. Stories about Walt, stories about the imagineers, and stories about Disney's Parks.

The book doesn't follow a serial flow. Instead, it is structured such that you can pick it up and start reading at any chapter. (I, however, read it front to back, but that was merely by choice.) Although all of the stories are interesting and provide insight into Walt and the history of the Disney company, I rather enjoyed the stories about Walt himself near the beginning of the book the most. Some of the best stories are "The Lake Buena Vista STOLport", "Walt Disney vs. the Air Pirates", and "Pooh for President", all collected and retold brilliantly by the author. My favorite story in _Progress City Primer_ is a humorous story about Walt Disney, Herb Ryman, and 49 tiny elephants in "Walt's Elephants". Although it's one of the shortest (if not _the_ shortest) story in the book, this one story alone is worth the price of the book.

The book ends with a appendix that collects Disney-related recipes, including a recipe for the iconic strawberry shortcake from the _Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue_ at Walt Disney World's Fort Wilderness.

I found _Progress City Primer_ difficult to put down and found myself in multi-chapter marathon reading sessions on airplanes as I travel. My only complaint is that after 33 fascinating stories, the book ended and I was wanting more. 

I highly recommend _Progress City Primer_ to anyone who is even a marginal Disney fan. You won't be disappointed.
