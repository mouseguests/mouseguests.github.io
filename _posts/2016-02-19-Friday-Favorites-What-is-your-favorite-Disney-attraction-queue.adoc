Although it's the shows and attractions (and the food) at Disney Parks that gets all of the attention, let's face it: We spend an enormous amount of time waiting to get to those headliners. Thankfully, many of the queues for Disney attractions are more than just switchbacks of ropes and chains. Some of them have interactive elements and others have fun things to look at while you wait.

So this week, we want you to let us know which of the attraction queues is your favorite. Is it the fortress and armory in the Magic Kingdom's Pirates of the Caribbean queue? How about the space exploration theme of Mission: SPACE in Epcot? Do you push books, play a haunted organ, and read the tombstones while waiting to enter the Magic Kingdom's Haunted Mansion? Do the artifacts on display in the queue for Expedition Everest in Disneys Animal Kingdom build up the excitement for coming face to face with the Yeti? Do you enjoy seeing pictures and stories of the pioneers of air travel in the queue for Soarin' in Disney California Adventure? Or do your kids (or you...admit it) like to dig around in Rabbit's garden and smudge honey on the wall while waiting to ride The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh in the Magic Kingdom?

Or maybe your favorite queue is the one with the shortest line?

Leave a comment and let us know which attraction queue in Disney World or Disneyland is your favorite! And don't wait there by yourself.
