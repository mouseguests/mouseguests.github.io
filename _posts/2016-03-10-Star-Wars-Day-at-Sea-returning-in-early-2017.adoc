The force is strong with this cruise.

Star Wars has never been more popular than it is now. And with the success of Star Wars Day at Sea on the Disney Cruise Line this year, Disney has announced that it will return for 2017, expanding to both eastern and western Caribbean 7-night itineraries. 

Special activities on the Star Wars Day at Sea include: Star Wars characters on-board for meet-n-greets, Star Wars trivia, Jedi Training, Star Wars-themed arts and crafts, a deck party, fireworks, Star Wars themed food and beverages, and film screenings of all seven Star Wars films plus a screening of the new "Rogue One" movie to be released later this year.

These Star Wars itineraries are limited to only 15 sailings from early January through mid-April from Port Canaveral. They're going to be really popular, so I recommend that you book your itinerary as soon as possible. May I also recommend that you contact raymie@simplymagicalvacations (or 214-236-7739) to get started on your Star Wars adventure at sea!
