In case you missed it, rumors have been circulating for the past few weeks that Disney is planning to retheme the _Twilight Zone Tower of Terror_ to "Guardians of the Galaxy". Despite overwhelmingly negative response to this rumor, we've just learned that Disney is not only moving forward with this move, but that the "Guardians of the Galaxy" plans are far more extensive.

We reached out to Disney for comment on the supposed plans to retheme the _Tower of Terror_. Disney spokesperson, Jessa Keating, confirmed that in addition to retheming the _Tower of Terror_, Disney had designs for retheming both Sunset and Hollywood Blvds in support of the upcoming "Guardians of the Galaxy" sequel.

Specifically, the following attractions will be directly impacted:

 * _Tower of Terror_ will be reworked as the _Tower of Knowhere_. The basic ride system will remain as-is, but instead of a 1930's Hollywood hotel, the building will be a tower that exists in the fictional "Knowhere" from the GotG comics and movies. We have seen concept art showing the members of the Guardians of the Galaxy beckoning riders to join them in place of the hotel guests from the current version of the ride.
 * _The Great Movie Ride_ will be renamed _The Groot Movie Ride_. Many of the same scenes that exist now will be reworked to include the lovable tree-like alien from GotG. Imagine Gene Kelly "Singin' in the Rain" while swinging from the side of Groot. Or how about the Wicked Groot of the West terrorizing Munchkinland? And the cowboy/gangster switchout portions of the ride will be exchanged for big Groot and a baby dancing Groot.
 * _Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith_ will be reworked as the _Rocket Raccoon Coaster_. Instead of riding a stretch limo through the freeways of L.A., the new _Rocket Raccoon Coaster_ will take you on a fast-paced ride on the _Milano_ as it crashes through the _Dark Aster_. The soundtrack will include music from "Awesome Mix Vol. 1".
 * _Fantasmic!_ will be replaced by _Draxtasmic!_, a musical and visual spectacular that explores the inner-thoughts of Drax the Destroyer as he dreams of revenge on Ronan the Accuser and struggles to understand common idioms as anything other than literal statements.
 * _Beauty and the Beast Live_ will be replaced with a musical stage show with a story formula similar to the existing show, except with Gamora, Thanos, and Star-Lord in the roles of Belle, Beast, and Gaston, respectively. 

We were especially confused by the _Beauty and the Beast_ replacement. Jessa assured us that it'd be a magnificent production, even if budgetary constraints will limit the show to follow the current show's story line.

Additionally, all of the dining and shopping venues along Sunset and Hollywood Blvds will be reworked to match the new theme. Although Jessa explained that details were still being finalized, she did mention that _Reel Vogue_ (formerly _Villains in Vogue_) will be themed as the Collector's shop. And she hinted that the popular cupcake source, _Starring Rolls_, will be renamed _Star-Lord Rolls_.

In related news, Jessa also may have leaked the new name being considered for Disney's Hollywood Studios. At one point in the conversation, she referred to the park as "Disney's Star-Lord Wars Muppet Toy Adventure". 

We have no news on the rumor that the _Tree of Life_ in Disney's Animal Kingdom will be replaced with a 199 foot tall Groot.

And now that April 1 as come and gone, we can now reveal this as an April Fools' joke and not real news. In case it wasn't obvious.
