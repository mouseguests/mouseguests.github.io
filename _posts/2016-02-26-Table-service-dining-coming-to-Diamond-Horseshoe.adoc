The Diamond Horseshoe in Disney World's Magic Kingdom was an opening day dining location, as the east-coast equivalent of Disneyland's Golden Horseshoe. But it has been only open rarely in the past dozen or so years. It has been used occasionally as overflow for Liberty Tree Tavern (which it shares a kitchen with) or as quick service, but many times we've walked by, it has been closed.

That changes on March 13th!

Disney has announced that the Diamond Horseshoe will start serving both lunch and dinner as table service dining options. Guests dining at the Diamond Horseshoe will feast on an all-you-care-to-enjoy meal that starts with a Frontier Salad and cornbread, giving way to a choice of BBQ pulled turkey over cornbread, spit-roasted ham and country beans, or stewed beef with mashed potatoes. The dessert course will be a choice of an apple tart or a Campfire Brownie. The meal will be fixed price at $33 plus tax for adults or $19 for children ages 3-9.
