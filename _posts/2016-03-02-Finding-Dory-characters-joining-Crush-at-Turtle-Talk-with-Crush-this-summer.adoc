New characts from Pixar's "Finding Dory" will be swimming up to the "Human Tank" this summer at _Turtle Talk with Crush_ in both Epcot and Disney California Adventure. The new characters will include Destiny the whale shark, Bailey the beluga whale, and Hank the "septopus". Even the little dude, Squirt, will be joining his old man to answer questions from the humans.

In case you're unfamiliar with _Turtle Talk with Crush_, it's a wonderfully fun interactive show where Crush from "Finding Nemo" interacts with the audience (mostly the younger dudes, but sometimes their parentals) answering questions about marine life and asking a few questions he has about human life.
