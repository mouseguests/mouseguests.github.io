After its most recent 6 year run in Disney World's Magic Kingdom, the Main Street Electrical Parade will return to Disneyland for a limited engagement in early 2017!

Starting in Disneyland in 1972, the Main Street Electrical Parade has a long history of crossing the country, having rolled through the Magic Kingdom 3 times and once each for Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. It will close its current run in the Magic Kingdom on October 9th.

The Paint the Night Parade is Disneyland's current nighttime light parade, debuting last summer for Disneyland's 60th Anniversary Celebration. Paint the Night will go in hiatus, returning on select nights during the holiday season.

It's uncertain at this time what this means for a nighttime parade in the Magic Kingdom. Will a new parade start rolling through the Magic Kingdom soon? Or will Paint the Night cross the country early next year to become the Magic Kingdom's nighttime parade? 

What do you think about this shift in nighttime entertainment in both the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland? Leave a comment and let's discuss!
