Can you believe it's already November? The holiday season is upon us. Holidays are traditionally spent with family and friends, eating lots of food, exchanging gifts, and being thankful for the blessings we are given. There's no place like home for the holidays. But for many Disney fans, "home" means Disney World!

We love visiting Disney World during the holidays. Our very first trip to Disney World was during the holiday season and all but two trips since then have taken place while Disney World is celebrating the season. Disney's holiday festivities are unlike any other. Here's what you can expect if you're planning a visit to Disney World during the holiday season.

Let's start our holiday tour of Disney World at the park that arguably celebrates the holiday season best, the Magic Kingdom.

== The Magic Kingdom
As you approach the Magic Kingdom you won't even get through the entrance before you see your first hint of a Disney Christmas. The train station will be decked out in garland and bows. And as you continue into the park and walk right down the middle of Main Street U.S.A., you'll continue to see holiday decorations on every building and light post.

The most significant decoration is, of course, the large Christmas tree in town square. Each of Disney World's parks has it's own specially themed Christmas tree and the Magic Kingdom's tree is enormous and covered with balls, peppermint sticks, gingerbread men, and a popcorn garland. You'll also notice the large toy soldiers guarding the perimeter of town square--They won't mind if you want them to be a part of your family's Disney Christmas photos!

If you hang around Main Street U.S.A. long enough, you'll likely be able to catch the Dapper Dans, dressed in their holiday duds, singing familiar Christmas songs. You may also catch the Citizens of Main Street joining in on the holiday fun.

As you progress to other lands in the Magic Kingdom, the decorations are a bit more subdued. But you'll still find hints of the holiday everywhere you go.

If you head over to Adventureland, you'll find one of the most notable holiday events of recent years. At this time of the year, the skippers of the world famous _Jungle Cruise_ get into the Christmas spirit and have transformed the attraction into the _Jingle Cruise_, complete with Christmas decorations and special holiday schtick. Even the boats are given new names like "Mistletoe Millie" and "Icicle Irma".

Night at the Magic Kingdom brings even more holiday cheer. On select evenings, November 7th through December 22, Mickey throws the biggest Christmas party ever. At _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_ you'll be able to celebrate the season with Mickey and all of his friends, complete with a special parade, fireworks display, shows, and more.

Here are a few of the things you can enjoy at _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_:

 * Opportunity to meet and greet with favorite Disney characters in their holiday clothes. This includes some characters that rarely appear in the parks, such as Jack Skellington as "Sandy Claws", all seven of the Seven Dwarfs, Disney princesses with their princes, and Captain Jack Sparrow.
 * Opportunity to meet with the big man himself, Santa Claus.
 * _Mickey's Most Merriest Celebration_ stage show at Cinderella Castle, all new for 2016.
 * _A Frozen Holiday Wish_ a stage show featuring Anna, Elsa, Olaf, and Kristoff from Disney's _Frozen_. The show culminates with Elsa "freezing" the castle, leaving it "frosted" with millions of lights.
 * _Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade_ featuring Mickey and other Disney favorites in a special Christmas-themed procession through Main Street U.S.A., Liberty Square, and Frontierland.
 * _Holiday Wishes_, a jaw-dropping holiday fireworks display, like none you have ever seen.
 * _Totally Tomorrowland Christmas_ a stage show in Tomorrowland between _Space Mountain_ and the _Carousel of Progress_ featuring Stitch, Mike Wazowski, and Buzz Lightyear and a cast of holiday singers and dancers.
 * _Club Tinsel Dance Party_ at _Cosmic Rays Starlight Diner_ where you can share the dance floor with Disney characters.
 * Special musical entertainment, such as a cappella group _VoicePlay_ or _The Notorious Banjo Brothers and Bob_ who recently left the Magic Kingdom but are scheduled to return for _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_ to perform their own special brand of yuletide music.
 * Free cookies and hot cocoa
 * Snow on Main Street U.S.A.!

Note that _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_ is a hard-ticket event (that is, it is not included in park admission and is an additional charge). Some of the holiday entertainment, such as _Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade_ and _Holiday Wishes_ will continue to run for all guests after _Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party_ ends on December 22nd.

== Epcot

Although the Magic Kingdom is the most festive of the four Disney World parks at Christmastime, Epcot's no Scrooge when it comes to its holiday offering.

Epcot's World Showcase is filled with food, events, and entertainment showcasing the holiday traditions of the 11 countries represented in World Showcase. Visit each of the country pavilions to participate and learn how that country celebrates the holidays. And, don't miss your chance to visit with Santa and Mrs. Claus in the American Adventure pavilion!

Epcot's Christmas tree is located in the World Showcase Plaza, which separates World Showcase from Future World. On this tree, you'll find decorations that reference various countries of the world.

Every night, from November 25th through December 30th, the _America Gardens Theatre_ presents the _Candlelight Processional_, a beautiful telling of the Biblical story of Christmas, along with a full orchestra and choir to weave music into the narration. Each night the story of Christmas is presented by a celebrity narrator. This year's celebrity narrators include:

 * Steven Curtis Chapman - November 25 to 27
 * Neil Patrick Harris - November 28 to December 1
 * Whoopi Goldberg - December 2 to 3
 * Edward James Olmos - December 4 to 6
 * TBD - December 7 - 9
 * Robby Benson - December 10 to 12
 * Meredith Vieira - December 13 to 15
 * Jim Caviezel - December 16 to 18
 * Joe Morton - December 19 to 21
 * Ming-Na Wen - December 22 to 24
 * Jodi Benson - December 25 to 27
 * Cal Ripken, Jr. - December 28 to 30

We had the privilege of seeing both Whoopi Goldberg and Andy Garcia narrate the _Candlelight Processional_ in 2012 and it was amazing!

The _Candlelight Processional_ is included with park admission with three shows nightly. It is an extremely popular event and it can be challenging to get a seat. Your best chances of getting in will require lining up well in advance of the show you want to see or by booking a dining package that includes guaranteed entry to the theatre. Alternatively, if you happen to walk by during a show, you might still be able to stand on the outside of the theatre and be able to see and hear most of the show.

While World Showcase hosts the bulk of Epcot's holiday events, you'll not want to miss _Joyful! A Gospel Celebration of the Season_ near the _Fountain of Nations_ in the middle of Future World.

Speaking of the _Fountain of Nations_, you should take time to stop and enjoy the breathtaking water ballet it performs throughout the day (imagine Las Vegas' Bellagio fountains on a smaller scale). While the _Fountain of Nations_ typically "dances" to a variety of songs from Disney movies and others, at this time of the year, you might see it perform to familiar Christmas songs. If you see the fountain during the day, don't forget to stop by again at night when the performance is painted with a rich palette of colorful lights.

Also, be on the lookout for holiday-themed topiaries through Epcot, especially near the main entrance in front of _Spaceship Earth_. These are popular photo spots to capture that special Disney Christmas photo.

Finally, end your night at Epcot by seeing _Illuminations! Reflections of Earth_, which traditionally includes a special holiday ending at this time of the year.

== Disney's Hollywood Studios

As you approach the entrance to Disney's Hollywood Studios, you'll notice the park's Christmas tree just outside of the gates. In keeping with the theme of the park, it is adorned with movie reels, film strips, clapboards, and other show-business inspired decorations.

image::holidays/dhs_christmastree.jpg[caption="The Christmas tree at Disney's Hollywood Studios"]

As you enter the park, you'll find Christmas decorations everywhere, especially along the storefronts of Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards.

This year, Santa Claus is meeting in Disney's Hollywood Studios for the first time. You'll find him in the _Once Upon a Time_ shop on Sunset Blvd from November 14th through December 24th. Of course, his schedule is already booked up after that, so Santa Goofy will fill in for him starting Christmas Day and through December 31st.

We always recommend making time to see the _Citizens of Hollywood_ when you are visiting Disney's Hollywood Studios, but that's especially true during the holidays. The improvisational comedy troupe adds a few holiday-themed routines to their schedule. One of our favorites is when their Holiday Glee club takes the street to perform (and mangle) a few of their favorite holiday songs.

image::holidays/coh_gleeclub.jpg[caption="The Citizens of Hollywood Holiday Glee Club"]

At night, an all-new fireworks and projection show will take place at center stage in front of the Chinese Theater (e.g., _The Great Movie Ride_). Join Wayne and Lanny (from Disney's _Prep & Landing_) for a totally tinsel holiday display which will include scenes from _Bambi_, _Cinderella_, _A Nightmare Before Christmas_, as they look for Santa Claus who has gone missing.

== Disney's Animal Kingdom

Disney's Animal Kingdom has the slimmest holiday offering of all of Disney World's parks. Even so, there are some subtle animal and nature-themed Christmas decorations to be found throughout the park. And don't miss the large Christmas tree just outside of the park entrance.

image::holidays/ak_christmastree.jpg[caption="The Christmas tree at Disney's Animal Kingdom"]

If past years are an indicator of what to expect in 2016, you may also find Santa Goofy greeting guests in Dinoland.

== Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney)

Aside from having a fantastic selection of shops where you can do your Christmas shopping, Disney Springs also celebrates the season with its own set of holiday events. New this year is a Christmas Tree Trail at Disney Springs Marketplace. In this walk-through experience, you'll encounter singers, toy soldiers, and (of course) Christmas trees, each decorated with a theme tied to a distinct Disney theme. Some of the themes include Mary Poppins, The Muppets, Cinderella, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and Disney Villains.

Disney promises to announce even more holiday events and festivities for Disney Springs as we get closer to the holidays, so stay tuned!

== The resorts

Each of the Walt Disney World resorts celebrates Christmas in its own way and it'd be impossible for me to cover each of the resorts' holiday fun. But you'll definitely want to visit some (or all) of the Deluxe Resorts where you'll be greeted by the smell of gingerbread before you even enter the door!

image::holidays/wildernesslodge_christmastree.jpg[caption="The Christmas tree at Disney's Wilderness Lodge Resort"]

In addition to a traditional Christmas tree, each of Disney's Deluxe Resorts boasts their take on an oversized gingerbread house. Some of the most impressive gingerbread structures we've seen include:

 * A working gingerbread carousel at Disney's Beach Club Resort
 * A Frozen-themed gingerbread display at Disney's Contemporary Resort
 * A life-sized gingerbread house at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort which also has a counter from which you can purchase gingerbread goodies!

image::holidays/beachclub_gingerbread_carousel.jpg[caption="Gingerbread Carousel at Disney's Beach Club Resort"]

Of course, all of the resorts are decked out with Christmas decorations, each themed in that resort's unique style. Of particular note, long-term guests of Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground traditionally decorate the campground with elaborate displays and are known to decorate the golf carts for the season as well.

== SUMMARY

By now you should have a good idea of what to expect when visiting Disney World during the holidays. It's truly the most wonderful time of the year and something you and your family should experience at least once.

Be warned, however, that Disney World crowds can get heavy during the holidays and can become unbearable as you approach Christmas Day. The best time to visit Disney World during the holidays is in early-to-mid November and the first week or two after Thanksgiving. The week of Thanksgiving and the week of Christmas (including Christmas Day) will no doubt be crowded and there is a strong chance of Disney invoking phased closures due to reaching capacity.
