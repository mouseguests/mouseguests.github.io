You may have already heard that in the past month, Disney has started testing premium parking at the Magic Kingdom. While this test has been received with mixed reviews, Disney has announced that they plan to move forward with what they are calling "Super Premium Magic Parking".

Currently, guests driving their own vehicles to the Magic Kingdom must park in parking lots that are separated from the Magic Kingdom by the Seven Seas Lagoon. Even with premium parking, a ride on a ferry boat or a monorail separates you from a day in the Magic Kingdom. But with this new super-premium parking option, guests willing to pay $99 per day will be able to position their car as close to the gates as possible.

According to Newt Riley, our contact at the Magic Kingdom, Disney will provide this new super-premium parking option with plans to fill and pave over the Seven Seas Lagoon. At roughly 175 acres, the space consumed by the Seven Seas Lagoon will offer a tremendous amount of parking for visitors who don't want to be bothered with riding the ferry boats or monorail from the Transportation and Ticket Center to the front gates. 

For more budget-conscious guests or those who would rather park further away, the remote parking spaces will still be available. Both the monorail and ferry boats will be available to shuttle guests from their remote space to the front gates. The ferries will be reworked to operate on pavement using the same trackless ride technology used in Hong Kong Disneyland's _Mystic Manor_ and Tokyo Disneyland's _Pooh's Hunny Hunt_. A wide path through the premium parking area will be kept clear for the ferry boats to operate.

And now that April 1 as come and gone, we can now reveal this as an April Fools' joke and not real news. In case it wasn't obvious.
