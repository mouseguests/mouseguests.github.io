Disney's new ticket prices take effect today, including seasonal pricing for 1-day tickets. What does it mean and how will it impact your pocketbook when you buy tickets?

As we reported yesterday, the price for 1-day tickets will vary, depending on when you go, what park(s) you want to visit, and whether or not you buy the Park Hopper option. Suppose you want to go to the Magic Kingdom today. Today is considered a "Value" day, so the price of a 1-day ticket to the Magic Kingdom will be $105. If, however, you want to visit the Magic Kingdom next Sunday, which is a "Regular" day, the price goes up to $110. And most of the later portion of March is categorized as a "Peak" day, taking the price up to $124.

On the other hand, should you want to visit Epcot, Hollywood Studios, or Animal Kingdom today, the price will be $97. Next Sunday it will be $102. And later in March it will go up to $114. 

If you want to be flexible and get the Park Hopper option, Value days will cost you $155, Regular days will be $160, and Peak days will ring up at $164, per 1-day ticket.

But if you're going to visit the parks for more than one day, then multi-day tickets are more economical and are not subject to seasonal pricing. And it gets cheaper per day as you add more days, with a 10-day ticket, without Park Hopper, being the cheapest per-day price point at $40 per day (before tax). The following table describes the prices for multi-day adult tickets (before tax):

To give you an idea of how this compares to multi-day prices before the price increase, we compared a multi-day ticket that we purchased before the price increase vs. what one would cost today. We paid $403.64 (incl. tax) for a 5-day ticket with Park Hopper a few weeks ago. Today that same ticket costs $435.59 (incl. tax) for a price difference of $31.95.

As for the effect on Disneyland prices, we know nothing more than we knew yesterday. At the moment, Disneyland's website is showing a picture of the 7 Dwarfs and a statement of "We're Working on It" when trying to view ticket prices.

How do you feel about seasonal pricing? Do you think it will spread the crowds out more? Would you be willing to pay the Peak day prices for a single-day ticket? Or does it not matter to you because you'll only ever buy multi-day tickets? Leave a comment below and let's discuss it!
