<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case you&#8217;ve missed it, Disney&#8217;s Hollywood Studios is undergoing a major overhaul. The original intent for the park was to be a working movie studio, with a few attractions along for the ride. Although a few movies were made at DHS (back when it was Disney-MGM Studios), including Mulan, Lilo &amp; Stitch, Brother Bear, and Ernest Saves Christmas, the plan to have a working studio never panned out. Over time, shows, rides and attractions were added to the park, but the Hollywood theme has been disjointed at best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an effort to correct the issues with DHS, Disney has announced two major new additions to the park: A 14 acre Star Wars-themed land and an 11 acre Toy Story-themed land. There&#8217;s also possibility of additional expansion to the park after those two lands are completed. And at last year&#8217;s Disney shareholder&#8217;s meeting, CEO Bob Iger let it slip that the park would be receiving a new name (it&#8217;s third name in its history).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this expansion come some growing pains. Some attractions have closed down and others are slated to be closed soon to make way for the construction of the new lands. Included among the attractions that have gone away in the past few years or are on their way out are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Studio Backlot Tour</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Lights, Motors, Action</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Magic of Disney Animation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sounds Dangerous</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The American Idol Experience</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Legend of Jack Sparrow</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pixar Pals Countdown to Fun</em> parade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mulch, Sweat, &amp; Shears</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights</em> (seasonal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Star Wars Weekends</em> (seasonal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sorcerer&#8217;s Hat (not an attraction, but it is gone)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a park that was already thought by some to be a half-day park, and with so many attractions going away, you may be wondering if you should skip Disney&#8217;s Hollywood Studios altogether on your next Disney World trip. After all, is there enough still open to fill a day in the park? To answer that question, let&#8217;s consider what&#8217;s still open:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Show</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Star Tours</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Jedi Training Academy</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Muppet*Vision 3D</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Toy Story Midway Mania</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Great Movie Ride</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One Man&#8217;s Dream</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Voyage of the Little Mermaid</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Disney Jr. Live</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Beauty and the Beast Live</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fantasmic!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Citizens of Hollywood (streetmosphere)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Star Wars Launch Bay</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sign-Along Celebration</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Symphony in the Stars: A Galactic Spectacular</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, I realize that at least a few of the entries on that list are rumored to be going away soon. But they&#8217;re not gone yet, so it&#8217;s fair to leave them on this list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know I can&#8217;t speak for every Disney World guest, but when I look at the list of recently closed attractions and compare it with the list of attractions still available, I don&#8217;t feel as if I&#8217;ve lost that much. I will absolutely miss things like <em>The Legend of Jack Sparrow</em>, Star Wars Weekends, and <em>Mulch, Sweat, &amp; Shears</em>. And I was there in December to say my final goodbye to the <em>Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights</em>. But aside from that, it&#8217;s a bunch of stuff that we hardly ever (if ever) visited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The list of still open attractions, on the other hand, represents many of the reasons we go to Hollywood Studios. They&#8217;re still open and we still have a reason to go; even if the rest of the park is behind construction walls for the next couple of years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give you an idea of how we spend a day in Hollywood Studios, what follows is a rough plan we go by:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Head to <em>Toy Story Midway Mania</em> at rope drop and ride it from the standby line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn around and use FastPass+ to ride <em>Toy Story Midway Mania</em> again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet-n-greet with Woody and Buzz Lightyear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Muppet*Vision 3D</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Star Tours</em>, probably with FastPass+</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Head back to center stage to see <em>Citizens of Hollywood</em>'s "Cavalcade of Stars"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Great Movie Ride</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on time, maybe walk through <em>One Man&#8217;s Dream</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lunch, either at <em>Backlot Express</em> or perhaps <em>50&#8217;s Prime Time</em> or <em>Sci-fi Dine-In</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Show</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Voyage of the Little Mermaid</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Star Wars Launch Bay</em> to meet Darth Vader and Chewbacca (or now it&#8217;s Kylo Ren and Chewbacca)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take in a few of the <em>Citizens of Hollywood</em> shows on Sunset and Hollywood Blvds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cupcakes at <em>Starring Rolls</em> (the Butterfinger cupcake is my favorite)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</em>, probably with FastPass+</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Beauty and the Beast Live</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on time and the lines, maybe <em>Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See some more <em>Citizens of Hollywood</em> shows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dinner (at one of the places we didn&#8217;t choose for lunch)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fantasmic!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then finish off with <em>Symphony in the Stars: A Galactic Spectacular</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just a rough plan. Dining reservation times, show times, and FastPass+ return times dictate the exact flow and some adjustment may be necessary. And we might pad some of that time with more character meet-n-greets and shopping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but that looks like a full day of fun to me. It certainly doesn&#8217;t look like the itinerary for a park that is half shutdown. In fact, I think it&#8217;d be difficult to fit all of that into a single day at Hollywood Studios. Once the new Star Wars and Toy Story lands open up, it will be impossible to take it all in in a single day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point is that even though there&#8217;s going to be a lot of construction walls around Hollywood Studios over the next several years, there&#8217;s still plenty to do. And the closings that have happened so far are a small price to pay for what promise to be some incredibly immersive new lands in the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even so, I will acknowledge that there&#8217;s not much in Hollywood Studios for smaller children (under 5) to enjoy. But this has always been the case and the closings have had little impact on that. Although <em>Disney Jr. Live on Stage</em> will be about their speed and they may enjoy <em>Toy Story Midway Mania</em>, height restrictions will keep them from enjoying many of the other attractions in the park. For parents of smaller children, we recommend that you take advantage of Rider Switch to enjoy a few of the key attractions at Hollywood Studios and then use Park Hopper to visit a park that has more for the little ones to enjoy.</p>
