<p>We reported yesterday that Disney is expected to introduce seasonal pricing (or demand pricing) this weekend. And now it is official. Starting tomorrow, 1-day tickets will be priced seasonally, based on demand. Disney presents this as a way to spread the crowds out, lowering the crowds on peak days by giving a pricing incentive to go on what are typically slower days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way it will work is that each month will have days that are designated as value, regular, and peak days. A 1-day ticket purchased for a value day will be less expensive than for a regular day which will be cheaper than for a peak day. It&#8217;s our understanding that 1-day Magic Kingdom ticket prices will be $124 for peak days, $110 for regular days, and $105 for value days, as compared to the current 1-day ticket price of $105. For the other parks in Disney World, the prices will be $114 (peak), $102 (regular), and $97 (value), as compared to the current 1-day ticket price of $97.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for Disneyland, the new price points for 1-day tickets will be $119 (peak), $105 (regular), and $95 (value), as compared to the current $99 price for 1-day tickets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We believe that seasonal pricing will have little effect on Walt Disney World guests, as those visiting Disney World typically purchase multi-day packages as part of a vacation package. Disneyland guests, on the other hand, are more likely to be impacted as many visitors to Disney&#8217;s west coast parks buy one day tickets, either because they&#8217;re locals or because they bunch their Disneyland trip in with other activities in the area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, tickets prices are expected to go up tomorrow as well on both 1-day and multi-day ticket packages. We do not yet know the new price points, but stay tuned to this blog and we&#8217;ll update you as soon as we know more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re planning a Disney World or Disneyland trip this year and have not yet purchased tickets or booked your vacation, we recommend you take care of that today before the prices go up. And in all cases, we advise that you always consider buying multi-day ticket packages as those will not be affected by seasonal pricing and the per-day price will be cheaper as you add more days. We recommend that you contact <a href="mailto:raymie@simplymagicalvacations.com">raymie@simplymagicalvacations.com</a> or by calling 214-236-7739 to get a free quote on your Disney vacation and snag those tickets before the prices go up.</p>
