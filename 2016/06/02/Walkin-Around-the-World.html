<p>Back in February, I shared our walking trip report for our December trip to Walt Disney World. I reported that on that 7 day trip, we walked over 68 miles and averaged 9.74 miles per day. Today, I want to update you on our most recent trip and take a look at how many miles we put in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This particular trip, April 29-May 3, was unique in the sense that Raymie was there for training purposes. This meant that for 2 days of our trip, it was mostly me and the girls exploring the parks without her. Given that she visited virtually every single Disney resort hotel on property, I&#8217;d wager that she put in a lot more miles than us. But I only have data for what I walked, taken from the Health app on my iPhone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s how we did:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apr 29th - 8.95 miles : We arrived mid-day and all of us went straight to the Magic Kingdom. After having lunch at <em>Skipper Canteen</em> (it was wonderful!), we hit as many attractions as we could. We ended up leaving just before park closing so we could catch a bus back to our resort (Port Orleans French Quarter) before the exiting crowds got too heavy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apr 30th - 10.32 miles : On this day, it was just the girls and me for a mostly full day at Epcot. We walked all over Future World in the morning, had lunch at Akershus, and then took a relatively quick tour of World Showcase to see all of the Flower and Garden Festival topiaries. We ended our day at Epcot early because we wanted to see Yehaa Bob at Port Orleans Riverside. We met up with Raymie, headed back to our resort for dinner at Sassagoula Floatworks and then walked over to Port Orleans Riverside to see Yehaa Bob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 1st - 8.02 miles : Again, Raymie was in training on this day, so me and the girls started our day in Animal Kingdom. We hit the highlights (<em>Festival of the Lion King</em>, <em>Kilimanjaro Safari</em>, etc) and had a quick lunch at <em>Pizzafari</em>. Then we hopped over to the Magic Kingdom in time to see <em>Festival of Fantasy Parade</em>, enjoy some attractions. We settled around the hub after dinner to stake out a spot for the <em>Main Street Electrical Parade</em>. Raymie met us there and then we went back to the resort to rest just as <em>Wishes</em> was starting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 2nd - 6.05 miles : With the full family together for the day, we went to Disney&#8217;s Hollywood Studios, riding <em>Toy Story Midway Mania</em>, <em>Star Tours</em>, <em>Tower of Terror</em>, <em>Rock 'n' Roller Coaster</em>, and taking some time in <em>Star Wars Launch Bay</em> to catch up with Kylo Ren and Chewbacca. We also caught a <em>Citizens of Hollywood</em> show  near the <em>Tower of Terror</em> before getting dinner at Hollywood &amp; Vine where we had reserved a table with the <em>Fantasmic!</em> dinner package. Unfortunately, some very intense storms blew through the area and instead of seeing <em>Fantasmic!</em> we were all huddled under the awning at the entrance of <em>50&#8217;s Prime Time Cafe</em> until the rain blew over. After the rain let up, we stuck around for <em>Symphony in the Stars</em> before heading back to the resort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 3rd - 6.78 miles : On our last day, we started our day with breakfast at <em>'Ohana</em>. Then we went back to the Magic Kingdom and hit as many attractions as could before having to leave for the airport.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s a total of 40.12 miles over the five days. Our average miles per day for this trip was 8.024&#8212;&#8203;lower than our December trip. I attribute the difference to the heat and us turning in early on most evenings. It was also a shorter trip, with one day being spent at Hollywood Studios (a smaller park requiring less walking) and two other days being half-days at the Magic Kingdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As before, I strongly recommend that you find comfortable shoes for your Disney vacation. Speaking for myself, I break a few common-sense rules and wear sandals. Generally, sandals are a poor choice for walking in Disney World or Disneyland, but for some reason my sandals (Teva Forebay) are more comfortable for me than most walking shoes. Raymie and the girls both like Skechers GOWalk. But what&#8217;s most important is that you find a shoe that is comfortable and fits right. And be sure to break it in by wearing it for at least a few weeks before your trip. I also recommend packing some moleskin, bandaids, and rub your feet down with an anti-friction stick every morning to avoid nasty blisters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We leave in two days for a weeklong trip to Disneyland. This will be our first Disneyland trip where I&#8217;ll track our miles. Stay tuned to this blog for a Disneyland walking report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How many miles have you logged on your Disney World or Disneyland trips? Have any tips on how to avoid blisters and aching feet? Leave a comment and let us know!</p>
