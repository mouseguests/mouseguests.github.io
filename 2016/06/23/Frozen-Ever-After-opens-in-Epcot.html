<p>Earlier this week, <em>Frozen Ever After</em> opened in Epcot&#8217;s Norway Pavilion. With the continued popularity of <em>Frozen</em>, this new attraction was inundated with long lines of people waiting to see how the kingdom of Arendelle is represented in this new dark ride.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standby lines extended past Epcot&#8217;s China Pavilion and had an expected wait time of over 5 hours. To make things worse, the ride went down several times during its first two days of operation, leaving guests waiting even longer to get in. To keep everyone cool, cast members were handing out free Mickey ice cream bars to those in line. As I write this, on the third day of operation, the posted standby lines are again at 300 minutes (although <a href="https://touringplans.com/disney-world-app">TouringPlans.com&#8217;s "Lines" app</a> suggests the actual wait might be 244 minutes).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, we haven&#8217;t had an opportunity to ride <em>Frozen Ever After</em> yet. That&#8217;s okay, though. We hope that by the time we visit Disney World later this year the lines will be shorter and the kinks will have been worked out. Even so, I&#8217;ve had a chance to view several of the on-ride videos that other guests have posted in the past couple of days and am rather impressed with what I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Maelstrom, _Frozen Ever After</em> is a combination boat and dark ride. It follows almost the identical course as <em>Maelstrom</em>, although the queue and loading area are now in what was previously a theater that showed a film about the history and culture of Norway. Instead of seeing Odin, vikings, polar bears, and oil derricks, <em>Frozen Ever After</em> takes you on a brief tour of Arendelle and Elsa&#8217;s ice castle. Along the way, you&#8217;ll see Olaf, Sven, the rock trolls, Sven, Anna, Kristoff, Marshmallow, and Snowgies. And, of course, you&#8217;ll see Elsa in her ice castle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I noticed about this attraction was how incredibly smooth and convincing the audio-animatronics are. Facial features are rear-projected, much like the faces of the Seven Dwarfs in the <em>Seven Dwarfs Mine Train</em>. But what&#8217;s more impressive is how much range of motion many of the audio-animatronic characters have and how smoothly they move. Most notably, the Elsa figure in the ice castle is incredible. It&#8217;s as if she has been transported out of the movie and is standing in front of you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also found it refreshing that this ride isn&#8217;t just an abridged retelling of the source story, like so many dark rides are. This is an all new story where Elsa is inviting everyone to her ice castle for a snowy summer celebration. Many of the popular songs from the movie are incorporated into the ride, although with new lyrics to fit the new story. The only song that seems unchanged is "Let it Go", which Elsa is singing in her ice castle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is easily one of the best dark rides Disney has ever done, on par with <em>Seven Dwarfs Mine Train</em> and approaching the quality of Hong Kong Disneyland&#8217;s <em>Mystic Manor</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only disappointment I had in watching the videos for this attraction is that Marshmallow doesn&#8217;t feature more prominently. I had imagined a rather large Marshmallow animatronic with a huge range of motion, not entirely unlike what <em>Expedition Everest</em>'s yeti was supposed to do. In fact, Harold, the abominable snowman in Disneyland&#8217;s <em>Matterhorn Bobsleds</em> moves about more than Marshmallow does in <em>Frozen Ever After</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m still unconvinced that a <em>Frozen</em> ride is fitting for Epcot&#8217;s Norway Pavilion&#8212;&#8203;I think it&#8217;d have been a better fit for the Magic Kingdom. Even so, I&#8217;ll admit Epcot needs more popular attractions like this to appeal to the younger audience and to balance crowds away from Future World attractions like <em>Soarin'</em> and <em>Test Track</em>. But if a <em>Frozen</em> attraction is going to be in Epcot, I&#8217;m glad that it is so well done.</p>
